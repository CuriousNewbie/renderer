# renderer
Simple 3d renderer on js
This renderer is JS implementation of the code from [ssloy tinyrenderer](https://www.example.com) code.

Run 'npm install` to install dependencies - browserify for building.
Run `npm run build` to bundle code.
Open index.js in browser and choose model and corresponding texture file for rendering - I have added  into repository two models, borrowed from **sloy**
